## 📌 About The Project

The **SPSU Hostel Leave ERP – Security Portal** is the gate-facing module of the larger Hostel Leave Management ecosystem. It is purpose-built for **security guards and supervisors** stationed at hostel entry/exit points.

Instead of manual registers, this portal provides a **live, digital dashboard** where security staff can:
- View all **approved leave/outgoing requests** in real time
- Mark a student's **physical gate exit (OUT)** and **return (IN)** with a single click
- Maintain a complete, exportable **leave movement audit trail**

This system eliminates paper logs, prevents unauthorized exits, and creates a tamper-proof record of every student movement.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication
- Secure **Employee ID + Password** login for security staff
- JWT-based session management stored via cookies
- Role-restricted access — only users with the `security` role can access portal routes

### 🟠 Out Entry (Gate Exit Logging)
- Displays all **pending approved requests** awaiting physical gate exit
- Security guard marks **Gate OUT** for each student to confirm departure
- Real-time status update to the central hostel management system
- Search by student name, enrollment number, or reason
- Filter by **custom date range**

### 🟢 In Entry (Gate Return Logging)
- Lists all students who have **exited and not yet returned**
- Mark **Gate IN** to confirm the student has returned safely to the hostel
- Identical search and date filter controls

### 📋 Leave Records (History & Audit)
- Full archive of **all completed leave and outing movements**
- Timestamped **Gate OUT and Gate IN** entries per student
- **Export to PDF** — landscape-formatted professional report with auto-table, title, and generation timestamp
- **Export to XLSX** — native Excel spreadsheet with granular columns:
  - Student Details, Enrollment No, **Hostel** (separate), **Room No** (separate), Applied From, Applied To, Reason, Gate Out, Gate In

### 🗂️ Resilient Timestamp Resolution
Gate OUT / Gate IN times are derived through a **multi-fallback chain**:
1. Explicit `action_time` in the action log
2. `updated_at` / `updatedAt` timestamp on the action document
3. MongoDB `_id`-encoded timestamp (ObjectId to UNIX)
4. Document-level `security_status` update timestamp
5. Falls back to `---` for genuinely pending entries

This guarantees the on-screen display and exported reports are **always in sync**.

```
/login                    → Security Staff Sign In
/security/out-request     → Gate EXIT logging (default landing)

/security/leave-records   → Full audit history + PDF/XLSX export
```

| Page | Purpose | Export |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **npm** ≥ 9
- A running instance of the **SPSU Hostel Leave Backend API**

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Self-Lakshh/Hostel-Leave-Security-ERP.git
cd Hostel-Leave-Security-ERP
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-api.com/api
```

> If `VITE_BASE_URL` is not set, the app defaults to `/api` (same-origin proxy).

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **`http://localhost:5173`**
